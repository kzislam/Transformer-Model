# Transformer-Model : Improved Streamflow Prediction Accuracy in Boreal Climate Watershed Using a Transformer Model
Deep Learning Transformer Model for Streamflow Forecasting in the Humber River, Newfoundland, Canada
The Upper Humber River Watershed (UHRW), located in the Atlantic boreal region of North America, encompasses approximately 2,800 square kilometers in Western Newfoundland, Canada. This region represents a critical area for studying streamflow dynamics due to its unique hydrological characteristics and climatic conditions. Previous studies have applied Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to this watershed, demonstrating their superior performance in streamflow prediction. Building on this foundation, this study aims to explore the capabilities of Transformer models in enhancing streamflow forecasting accuracy.

# Study Objectives
Evaluate Transformer Model Performance: Assess the performance of the Transformer model in forecasting streamflow within the Humber River basin, Newfoundland, Canada.

Capture Complex Dynamics: Investigate the ability of Transformer models to effectively model the complex temporal and spatial dynamics of streamflow in the UHRW.

Quantitative Performance Metrics: 
Analyze the performance of Transformer models using the following metrics:
  Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE),
  Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE),
  Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
  Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²).

This study seeks to provide insights into the potential of Transformer models for hydrological forecasting and contribute to improved water resource management strategies in the region.
